If you're interested in my experience, I'm happy to share more on my technical projects upon request.

I am currently working as a student research assistant with Georgia Tech Center of Health and Humanitarian Systems. 
I have worked on several tasks diving into analysis, visualization, and simulation modeling, and I am currently designing a self-service dashboard for Georgia Department of Public Health to answer their questions on COVID vaccine 
and adverse outcome disparities in Georgia across different racial and social vulnerability categories.

While the current iteration is confidential, you can see some of the initial designs for decision support dashboards I contributed to at https://chhs.gatech.edu/covid19-dashboard.
