This project was my earliest endeavor into data analytics. I was incredibly interested in just how much COVID vaccinations were playing a role in adverse outcomes, so I dived deep to find some deep relationships. 



In this repository you can see some of the visualizations on the statistics I collected. The pynb file contains information on what statistics I gathered and what I concluded from them.

If you'd like to see more, or are interested in the regression portion of the project where I compared trends before and after mass distribution of vaccines, those are available upon request.
